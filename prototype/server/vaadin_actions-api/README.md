Introduction
==============

This prototype aims to build the foundations of the actions and nodes APIs. It's also a proof of concept on how the context menus would work. This prototype does not use the Vaadin ContextMenu add-on as we will try to keep external dependencies as less as possible. It also requires a fork of the original Vaadin's Google Maps Add-On that implements extra events such as marker right click and polyline click and right click.

Dependencies
=============
Google Maps add-on for (see Kuwaiba's repository/third-party folder) and a Google Maps developer key would be also necessary if you want to test the actions on map views.
