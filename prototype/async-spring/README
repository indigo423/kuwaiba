This demo showcases how to lunch multiple jobs (threads) on a server and keep track of them from a client, polling periodically a RESTful webservice.

To test it, start the server and then the client and take a look at the respective messages in the output window. 
You can tune some variables, such as the max number of threads available or up to how many CPU cores to use in the 
server's application.properties file
