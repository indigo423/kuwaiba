/**
 * A composed action is an action used to show sub-menus or to perform a set of instructions
 * to after the main actionPerformed is called. Most of these actions are used so the sub-menu is created lazily 
 * as an external JFrame/JDialog instead of an actual sub-menu as in JMenu. When node actions show sub-menus using
 * JMenus, the options are not loaded lazily and if they involve calls to the server to be generated, that might imply
 * extra, unnecessary requests to the server.
