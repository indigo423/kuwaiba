0.2.1 - 0.3
* There's a single root for all entity classes: RootObject
* The former RootObject (parent of all classes to be listed within the inventory (This is equipment, services, etc) is now know as InventoryObject
* The helper entity classes like metadata stuff, queries, views, etc have their own branch which roots are MedataObject and ApplicationObject
* "Query" is subclass of ApplicationObject
* "AirConditioning" goes to ConfigurationItem
* "Slot" goes to ViewableObject
* The "NoCount" annotation was added to decorate all those classes pertaining to the inventory, but that are not necessary to be "counted" (they don't have serial numbers or are actually assets), like Slots, Ports or City/Continent/State
* StateObject was renamed to State
* "GenericContainer" goes to ConfigurationItem
* "AdministrativeItem" goes to InventoryObject
* "parent" (attribute) is no longer a single long, but a reference to another InventoryObject in order to protect the data integrity
* "serialNumber" (attribute) in ConfigurationItem is now decorated with NoCopy and Column.unique=true
* "isAccountable"(attribute) in ClassMetadata was renamed to isCountable (this is directly related to the NoCount annotation)
