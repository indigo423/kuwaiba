/**
 * Validators are flags indicating things about objects. Of course, every instance may have
 * something to expose or not. For instance, a port has an indicator to mark it as "connected physically",
 * but a Building (so far) has nothing to "indicate". This is done in order to avoid a second call to query
 * for a particular information that could affect the performance. I.e:
 * Call 1: getPort (retrieving a LocalObjectLight) <br>
 * Call 2: isThisPortConnected (retrieving a boolean according to a condition) <br>
 *
 * With this method there's only one call
 * getPort (a LocalObjectLight with a flag to indicate that the port is connected) <br>
 *
 * Why not use getPort retrieving a LocalObject? Well, because the condition might be complicated, and
 * it's easier to compute its value at server side. Besides, it can involve complex queries that would require
 * more calls to the web service
