/**
 * A filter is a query that, given a set of input parameters, returns a list of inventory assets. Queries
 * are usually complex and can not be done using the Query Manager alone. These queries can be embedded 
 * in multiple modules, so they can be used to filter what information is displayed. A typical use case is the 
 * navigation module: Filters applicable per class are created and, when a user selects an object, it is possible to
 * expand de navigation tree showing its direct children or apply a filter to display only a predefined set (for example, 
 * in a network device show only the ports and skip cards and slots). A {@link FilterDefinition} instance contains 
 * the metadata of a Filter (name, if it's enabled, the corresponding script), while a filter instance can 
 * execute code. Filters are Groovy scripts containing subclasses of Filter. These classes are compiled 
 * on-the-fly and the instances cached to be executed on demand.
