/**
 * This class describes the generic behavior of all the synchronization providers.
 * A sync provider is just a bunch of logic that actually performs the actions associated to a set of business rules when differences
 * are found between the information retrieved from sync data sources (SNMP-enabled devices, NMS, legacy systems, third-party monitoring systems, etc)
 * and the information in the inventory. The flow is basically the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A Sync Job (a simple Java EE batch job) is started.</li>
 * <li>The sync job connects to the sync data sources (devices, databases, etc) and retrieves
 * the information defined in the Sync Data Definition Artifact, which is a file or a Kuwaiba
 * database entry (depends on the implementation) that contains what information will be retrieved from the sync data sources (columns of a table, OIDs, etc)
 * </li>
 * <li>The next stage of the Sync Job asks the Sync Provider to find the differences between the info extracted
 * from the sync data source and the corresponding info in Kuwaiba. The sync provider will return the differences</li>
 * <li>The Sync Job either forward the differences to the user requesting for authorization to perform actions
 * (create/delete elements, update properties, etc) or will perform them automatically</li>
 * <li>The sync job performs the actions with external intervention (e.g. human approval)
 * or automatically, depending on how the sync provider is configured</li>
 * </ul>
