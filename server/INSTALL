Migration steps specific for version 0.3 beta
---------------------------------------------
Your old postgresdb doesn't need to be upgraded drastically, it's only necessary to create 
manually a table since db migration tool will be ready only as of version 0.3 stable.
Open a postgres client (psql or PGadmin) and run the following SQL sentences:

CREATE TABLE query
(
  id bigint NOT NULL,
  "content" bytea,
  description character varying(255),
  "name" character varying(255),
  owner_id bigint,
  CONSTRAINT query_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_query_owner_id FOREIGN KEY (owner_id)
      REFERENCES users (id) MATCH SIMPLE
      ON UPDATE NO ACTION ON DELETE NO ACTION
)
WITH (
  OIDS=FALSE
);
ALTER TABLE query OWNER TO kuwaibadbuser;
