===== Glassfish/Payara 5 Compatibility =====
* //java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: sun/security/ssl/SupportedEllipticCurvesExtension//
Glassfish 5.0 uses a Grizzly version that is not quite compatible with Java versions above 8u152 (see [[https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues/2344|here]]). So you either downgrade your JDK version or try GF 5.0.1 [[https://download.oracle.com/glassfish/5.0.1/nightly|nightly builds]].

* //java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException: Task java.util.concurrent.FutureTask//
This bug in Glassfish 5 occurs when the deployment package is too big (100MB+) and it fails to process the whole default-sized thread pool queue. 
→  For old Payara 5 versions (prior u191) [1]:
 asadmin set-payara-executor-service-configuration --threadpoolexecutorqueuesize 1000
→  u191 should work out-of-the-box, however, if a "//Could not find or load main class server\payara5\glassfish.lib.grizzly-npn-bootstrap.jar//" appears (due to conflicts with the Payara Tools for Eclipse component), you should edit the ''domain.xml'' file to modify the Xbootclasspath parameter as described in [2].
