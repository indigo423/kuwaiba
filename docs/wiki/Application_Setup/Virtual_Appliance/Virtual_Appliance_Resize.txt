====== Virtual Appliance Resize ======
^{Created Monday 11 March 2019 @author Jalbersson Plazas}

The format of the virtual disk (kuwaiba-virtual-appliance.vmdk) used in the Kuwaiba Virtual Appliance doesn't allow the direct resizing, so in order to expand its capacity
you need to follow these steps:

1. Make a copy of the disk in vdi format, that is obtained throug the command: "VBoxManage clonehd kuwaiba-virtual-appliance.vmdk copyDiskName.vdi --format vdi" used in a terminal located where the kuwaiba-virtual-appliance.vmdk is.
2. Change the size of the copy disk to the desired new size, this is obtained using the following command: "VBoxManage modifyhd copyDiskName.vdi --resize 5120" assumming you want to resize the disk to 5GB.
3. Now you have more space but it's not identified if you use directly the virtual machine, so you need to used GParted to use the new available space on the disk. To acomplish this:
4. Download a GParted live iso file available in https://gparted.org/.  
5. In Virtual Box select the Virtual appliance, go to Storage section, in the optical Drive load the GParted live iso, in the Controller Sata remove the vmdk file and add the copyNameDisk.vdi. {{~/Downloads/vmStorageMarked.png}}{{~/Downloads/gparted.png}}{{~/Downloads/gpartedSetup.png}}
6. Start the Virtual Appliance, this will start GParted and there you need to delete [[/dev/sda2/]] (extended partition) so that the space in the disk looks like 80% of used disk space and a non assigned space. {{~/Downloads/devsdaInitial.png}}
7. Now right click the used space, expand size and resize so that a section for the swap space is left. {{~/Downloads/resizePartition.png}}
8. Assign the swap space and you are ready to apply the changes.                                                          {{~/Downloads/applyChangesVM.png}}

The disk now has the new size but it's still in vdi format. Now to return to its original format, vmdk, follow ththis actions:
a. In VirtualBox select the Kuwaiba Virtual Appliance, go to Storage, remove the GParted live iso file and the copyNameDisk.vdi file.{{~/Downloads/removeGParted.png}}
b. Using the terminal located where the copyNameDisk.vdi file is, use the command 'VBoxManage clonemedium "copyNameDisk.vdi" "kuwaiba-virtual-appliance.vmdk" --format vmdk'. This will make a copy of the vdi file in vmdk format with the new size.
c. In VirtualBox in File section select Virtual Media Manager. Remove the old files which you can identify by the disk space and add the new kuwaiba-virtual-appliance.vmdk file. Note the even that you overwrite the old one you need to do this due to UUID's inconsistency.

Now you are ready to star the Kuwaiba Virtual Appliance with its new size.
